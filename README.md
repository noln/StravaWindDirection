# Strava Wind Direction Thingy

## Whassat?

It's a tiny Chrome Extension that shows an arrow corresponding to wind direction on Strava activities. I don't get why this isn't already a feature already..

## Why did you do this?

Following a discussion today with someone who insisted that wind direction indicated was the direction that it is blowing *to*, rather than the direction it is blowing *from*, I got annoyed and rage-coded this.

It adds an arrow that removes the guesswork, to assist those that are meteorologically-challenged.

## How do I install it?..

It's an unpublished Chrome Extension, so just drag-and-drop the whole folder into `chrome://extensions` and tada, you're done.
